### 1\. **Introduction to DevOps**

* **Definition**: Explain that DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.
* **Principles**: Describe the core principles of DevOps, like Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), collaboration, and automation.
* **Benefits**: Discuss how DevOps improves speed, efficiency, and the reliability of software deployments.

### 2\. **Cloud Computing**

* **What is Cloud Computing**: Define cloud computing as delivering computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software) over the cloud to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
* **Types of Cloud Services**: Explain IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service).
* **Cloud Deployment Models**: Introduce Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and Multicloud strategies.
* **Popular Cloud Providers**: Mention AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

### 3\. **Linux Basics and Administration**

* **Overview**: Explain that Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems. Mention its significance in server environments and development.
* **Essential Commands**: Cover basic commands like file navigation (`ls`, `cd`), file manipulation (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`), permissions (`chmod`, `chown`), and networking commands.
* **System Administration**: Discuss user management, service management, and system monitoring tools.

### 4\. **Shell Scripting**
